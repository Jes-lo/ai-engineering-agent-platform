# AI Engineering & Agent Platform

A self-hosted AI engineering and agent platform built as a portfolio
project to demonstrate secure, observable, testable, and maintainable AI
platform engineering practices.

## Status

Early development.

The repository contains the initial governance, security, architecture,
and Python/FastAPI application foundation.

AI models, RAG, agents, persistent storage, tools, MCP integrations, and
workflow capabilities have not yet been implemented.

## Planned Capabilities

The platform is intended to evolve incrementally toward capabilities
including:

- model-provider abstraction;
- local and remote model adapters;
- embeddings;
- PostgreSQL and vector search;
- retrieval-augmented generation;
- retrieval and reranking;
- grounded responses and citations;
- agent execution;
- tool calling;
- MCP integrations and a project-owned MCP server;
- workflow automation;
- human-in-the-loop approval;
- guardrails;
- evaluation datasets and automated evaluations;
- AI and application observability;
- OpenTelemetry;
- metrics and dashboards;
- CI/CD and software supply-chain controls;
- an AI Developer Console.

Capabilities listed here describe project direction and are not considered
implemented until corresponding code, tests, documentation, and validation
are merged.

## Local Development

The project currently targets Python 3.13.15 and uses `uv` for dependency
and environment management.

Synchronize the environment:

    uv sync

Run the API locally:

    uv run uvicorn ai_engineering_agent_platform.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

Current system endpoints:

- `GET /health` - liveness;
- `GET /ready` - readiness.

Run local validation:

    uv run pytest
    uv run ruff format --check src tests
    uv run ruff check src tests
    uv run mypy src tests

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions validates pull requests and pushes to `main`.

The current CI baseline includes:

- GitHub Actions workflow linting;
- locked Python environment synchronization;
- formatting;
- linting;
- strict static type checking;
- automated tests with warnings treated as errors;
- package build validation;
- Git history and working-tree secret scanning;
- dependency vulnerability auditing;
- dependency-license inventory;
- CycloneDX SBOM generation and validation.

Supply-chain reports are generated during CI and retained as workflow
artifacts for a limited period.

## Architecture

Architecture decisions and supporting documentation are maintained under:

- `docs/adr/`
- `docs/architecture/`
- `docs/security/`
- `docs/ai-safety/`
- `docs/operations/`

## Engineering Standards

Development and feature completion standards are documented in:

- [Development Standards](docs/operations/development-standards.md)
- [Definition of Done](docs/operations/definition-of-done.md)
- [AI Safety Principles](docs/ai-safety/ai-safety-principles.md)

## Security

Security is treated as a first-class design requirement.

See:

- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- [Threat Model](docs/security/threat-model.md)
